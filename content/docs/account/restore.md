## Backup

Backups are **very important** and must be taken unless you don't mind losing access to the account
and the coins it contains.

Fortunately, it is very easy to make a backup.

> The account backup is the 24 words (in sequence) displayed on the Backup page (**seed phrase**)

When you create a new account, the app will show you the Backup page automatically.
If you need to recall that page, open the app menu and select "Backup".

The content of the Backup page varies depending on the type of account:

- If you create a new account, the backup is the seed phrase
- If you restore the account, the backup is the information you provide
- If you make the account watch-only, the backup is the viewing key

## Restore

To restore an account, go to the "Accounts" page and click on the button "+".

1. Enter the account name
2. Enter the seed phrase, secret key, or viewing key
3. Press the button "ADD"

You can add/restore several accounts. When you leave the account manager page,
the app will ask you if you want to rescan the blockchain if needed.

> Scanning updates every account. You don't need to rescan each new account individually
