YWallet automatically creates the first account. Please make sure that you save the seed words when it reminds you. The seed words are the list of 24 words shown on the backup page. 
If you lose access to your phone or wallet, all you need are these words. But conversely, anyone with these words also has access to your funds.

{{% notice warning %}}
The seed words must be kept in a safe place and away from prying eyes. The order, spelling and capitalization of the seed words
are significant.

## Notes

- You can tap on the disc icon to get a QR code and save it instead.
- Do not save your seed words to Cloud storage.
- Treat the seed words as you would treat a **signed blank check** to all your funds
