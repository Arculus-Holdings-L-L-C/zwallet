1. When checked, the app retrieves your transaction details (address & memo).
It needs to send the transaction ID to the server. Therefore, the server
can know which transactions belong to you
2. When checked, your account balance will be hidden on the account page if 
your device is tilted forward or is put down
3. When checked, sending coins require pin or biometrics authentication

## Remarks

- Running your personal deployment of `lightwalletd` is the best way to keep
all of your information private
- Changing the setting "Protect Send" also require authentication
