# Contacts

Contacts are a convenient way to organize your frequently used addresses.


{{< img_index IMG_0070.PNG >}}

1. Contact Name
2. Contact Address
3. Tap to go to the Send page with this contact address
4. Add a new contact
5. Long press to edit the name
6. Swipe left/right to delete

## Remarks

- On the Send page, you can enter a contact name instead of an address
- Wherever the app displays an address, it will display a contact name
if there is a contact with that address.
- Contacts are shared between all accounts
