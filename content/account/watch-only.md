You can turn a regular account into a watch-only account. This prevents
you or anyone from spending from it. You will still be able to receive coins
and monitor the balance.

Making an account watch-only is **NOT** reversible and you must have a backup
of the seed phrase to restore the account later.

1. Select the Advanced Menu from the app menu, then "Convert
to Watch-Only"
2. Choose "DELETE" 

If you imported an account with a viewing key, your account is already
watch-only.
