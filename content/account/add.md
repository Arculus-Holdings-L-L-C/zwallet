1. Your backup is the 24 words in the top box. You must keep these words in a safe place. The
order of the words is important. 
2. For your convenience, the app can show you a QR code for your seed phrase when you press the icon
next to the box.

Notes: 

- The account name is required. It does not have to be unique.
- If the "Seed/Secret Key or View key" field is not blank but
does not contain a valid value, the "ADD" button is disabled.
- If you want to restore a previous account, [go to this page]({{< relref "restore.html">}})
- Below the seed phrase, you will find your secret key and your viewing keys.
You do not need to save them because they can be derived from your seed phrase. They are provided
in case you need to use another app that does not support seed phrases.
