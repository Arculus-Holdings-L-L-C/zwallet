The Receive/Payment URI page is for making QR codes that encode

1. the payment URI QR (or address if amount is zero)
2. the payment URI
3. If the coin supports UA, list of receivers included in the address
4. Copy URI to clipboard
5. an amount requested in coins
6. or in fiat currency
7. and a memo text
8. Reset values to default

## Quick Actions

You can start a send/receive transaction directly from the app launcher / dashboard
by long pressing the app icon.

## Remarks

- When the app scans a QR code and detects a payment QR, it automatically
fills the amount and memo.
- When you scan a Payment URI with the iOS Camera app, it will offer to
open the app.
