After a major upgrade, the app may exhibit incorrect behavior.
If this happens, the easiest way to fix the issue
is to uninstall, reinstall and restore from seed.

{{% notice warning %}}
You should always have a safe copy of your seed phrase
{{% /notice %}}

If your phone or computer crashes and you don't have the seed phrase,
your funds are **LOST**. 

But if you really don't have the seed phrase and the app is still working
you can try resetting it by following the instructions below.

Resetting the app should be done as a last resort as it will
attempt to rebuild your database and *may* leave it in a worse
state than it is.

Please read and follow these instructions carefully:

1. Go to the About Page. **Make sure you have version 1.2.3 or above**
2. Long Press on the version number
3. Confirm you want to reset the app
4. Close and **restart** the app. Because of app store policies,
an app is not allowed to restart programatically. Make sure you
have closed the app. The app shows the "Loading" screen on
restart
5. Reselect your current account
6. Rescan
