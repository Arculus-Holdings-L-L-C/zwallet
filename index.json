However, it is able to build an unsigned transaction and export it as a file.\nThe account owner moves the file to another computer that holds the secret key (preferably offline and air-gapped for security).\nOn the offline computer, he signs the transaction and generate a now valid transaction that he saves to another file.\nAfter importing the later into the Y/ZWallet, the transaction is finalized and broadcast.\nThis workflow ensures that the secret key never leave the computer that is isolated from the Internet.\nCold Storage in the context of Bitcoin\nThe same concept is applicable to Zcash.\nQR codes or Files  Choose QR codes if your signing device and your cold wallets have cameras and are in close proximity, Use files otherwise  Preparing the unsigned transaction If the account does not have a secret key either because it was restored from viewing key or because it was converted to Cold Storage, the button Send is dimmed. Instead of signing and broadcasting a transaction, the Send page prepares an unsigned transaction.\nQR Code If you enabled the \u0026ldquo;Use QR codes for offline signing\u0026rdquo;, you will get an animated QR code:\nThe transaction is too large to fit in a single QR code. YWallet uses animated QR codes with error correction (RaptorQ).\n Files Depending on your phone OS, you can save the unsigned transaction to a USB key, or to the Cloud.\nThe transaction file must be copied to the computer that has the sign application.\nSign There are two options for signing the transaction. You can either use a command line tool (with no GUI) or use another phone/device with YWallet that you keep offline.\nWe recommend using another phone as the signer. Please, make sure that it was factory reset and that it was never connected to the Internet.\n Command Line Tool You can build the sign app from its source code\nTo run the sign app, you need to create an .env file that has a line\nKEY=\u0026quot;\u0026lt;seed or secret-key\u0026gt;\u0026quot; For example,\nKEY=\u0026quot;human tissue pony dose host stamp tag hockey begin wisdom humble divorce goose grief analyst hard axis fiscal flat cloud huge pair sunset into\u0026quot; Then run the signer as follows:\nsign \u0026lt;unsigned filename\u0026gt; \u0026lt;signed filename\u0026gt; For example,\nsign tx.json tx.raw Then copy tx.raw back to a USB drive (or Cloud storage)\nOffline Ywallet Use the \u0026ldquo;Sign\u0026rdquo; menu. It will ask you to open the unsigned transaction file and proceed to sign it. If the current account contains the secret key it will create a raw transaction and offer you to save it.\nQR Code Point your camera and scan the animated QR code. Every time a QR code is captured, your phone will make a little \u0026ldquo;click\u0026rdquo;.

This feature is intended for cases when you need to recover accounts from other wallets. Since shielded addresses are not visible on the blockchain, there is no advantage in using more than one address. In case you want to give out a unique address, diversified addresses (or snap addresses in Ywallet) offer a better scalable solution.\n Scan Transparent Addresses If you have funds in transparent sub accounts, Ywallet can automatically find them for you. Use the Scan Accounts button and Ywallet will scan the transparent addresses at sequential indices starting from 1. It will stop when there are 10 (gap limit) consecutive addresses without funds.

If your wallet is slow, it is most likely because of synchronization.\nWallets need to keep up with the latest data from the blockchain. This process is called synchronization and differs greatly between privacy coins and regular coins.\nLight wallets do not have the entire blockchain data. They rely on a server to give them enough information to rebuild the account balance and transaction history.\nWith non-privacy coins, servers can index the blockchain and keep a database of every account. When light wallets ask them for their specific account data, the server retrieves the information and directly returns it to the client.\nHowever, this is not possible with privacy coins. They encrypt or shield the transactions recorded on the blockchain and prevent any external entity from knowing their details.\nLight wallets can either:\n download and decrypt the blockchain data themselves. But they would not be \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; anymore. or send their decryption key (i.e. the viewing key) and let the server filter the transactions. But it reduces the user\u0026rsquo;s privacy because now, the server has the viewing key.  Zcash (and its forks) implements a mixed approach. A specialized server called lightwalletd filters the data from a full node zcashd and keeps only the data needed for transaction identification.\nLight wallets only have to download the trimmed data (Compact Blocks). Then they decrypt these compact blocks themselves.\nYet, even decrypting and processing compact blocks can take a significant amount of time.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Warp Sync? Explain Like I\u0026rsquo;m 5 Synchronization in other wallets works by processing transactions one by one. With Warp Sync, YWallet can process multiple transactions together.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an analogy. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to calculate $1+2+3+4+5+6+\u0026hellip;+1000$.\nWe can perform the series of additions and keep a partial sum. $1+2 = 3$. Then $3+3 = 6$, and $6+4 = 10$, etc. Eventually, we will reach $1000$ and have our total sum.\nHowever, when we notice that\n$$ \\begin{aligned} 1 + 1000 \u0026amp;= 2 + 999 \\cr \u0026amp;= 3 + 998 \\cr \u0026amp;= 4 + 997 \\cr \\end{aligned} $$\nwe can calculate twice the desired value as follows,\n$$ \\begin{aligned} (1+\\dots+1000) \\times 2 \u0026amp;= (1+1000) + (2+999) + \\dots \\cr \u0026amp;= 1001 \\times 1000 \\cr \\end{aligned} $$\nAnd our result is\n$$ \\frac{1001 \\times 1000}{2} $$\nJust by rearranging the terms of our calculation, we were able to get a massive performance boost.\nWarp Sync skips the intermediate results and jumps straight to the final result.\n This is just an analogy. Zcash synchronization is much more complex. Warp Sync still has to do a lot of computation.\nIf that sounds too good to be true It\u0026rsquo;s because it\u0026rsquo;s not exactly true. Warp Sync still has to perform a number of hash calculations proportional to the number of shielded transaction outputs. However, the usual synchronization method needs several times more than that.\nAny drawback? Not really, in the end the result is identical bit by bit. We don\u0026rsquo;t have the intermediate values but we don\u0026rsquo;t need them anyway.\nHow fast is WarpSync compared to Normal Sync The benchmark consists of restoring a wallet from seed and resynchronizing from the first block.\nIn this benchmark, Warp Sync runs 300 times faster than Normal Sync.\n Nighthawk (NH) Benchmark: 12 hours 30 minutes Ywallet (YW) Benchmark: 2 minutes  This chart shows the synchronization progress in % per second. A value of 100 means the speed is 100% per second, i.e. the synchronization takes 1 second.\nSpeed varies because some blocks have more transactions than others.\n NH is in blue and YW is in red. Higher values mean better performance Note that the Y-scale is logarithmic.  Performance varies with wallets and hardware. Your experience may differ but you should see a significant improvement nonetheless. We benchmarked Nighthawk because it uses the classic synchronization method. Unstoppable, Edge, etc. are also using the same algorithm and show similar results.\n Other Performance Optimizations  Warp Sync has a custom implementation of the Hash algorithm for an extra few percent speed up It leverages batch trial decryption for another few percentage points. It implements a streaming processing pipeline which can maximize your download speed and keep all your CPU cores fully utilized. The pipeline downloads and processes a moving window of the compact blockchain. It limits memory usage to a minimum.

The app is Shielded by Default.\n  How fast is the synchronization exactly?\nIt depends on the hardware but for average phones, YWallet scans the entire blockchain (as of Sep 2021) in around 1-3 minutes. In the end, your account balances are fully available to spend. The reference wallet SDK is 100x slower.\n  Was there a ZWallet and WarpWallet?\nThere used to be different versions of the app for Ycash and Zcash. The app was initially built for Zcash and was called ZWallet. Then it was ported to Ycash and named YWallet. Unfortunately, the name ZWallet is taken on the Apple Store and the app had to be rebranded WarpWallet.\nNow we have a single version that works for both Ycash and Zcash and the app ZWallet is discontinued.\n  Is it open source?\nYes, the source code is available on github.\n  Why is it not listed on the Zcash website?\nThe source code is pending review by the Zcash team. However, it has been reviewed by the Ycash team and is listed on the Ycash Foundation website.\n  Does it collect data?\nAbsolutely no user data is collected. The wallet only connects to a lightwalletd server (by default the officially sponsored server) and CoinGecko for market prices.\n  Can it connect to any lightwalletd?\nYes, the wallet uses the standard API of lightwalletd. It can connect to ZecWallet version of lightwalletd or your own deployment.\n  Can I receive my mining rewards in my transparent address?\nIt is best not to receive your mining rewards because they need to mature for 100 blocks before they can be spent. The Y/ZWallet cannot shield your balance if any of the UTXO is not old enough. Currently, lightwalletd does not provide an API to get the UTXO age and the shielding transaction will be rejected by the network.\n  How can I keep my account safe?\nThe number one reason for lost coins is failure to have a backup of the seed phrase.\nPlease, DO A BACKUP ASAP and make sure that it is kept in a safe place away from spying eyes.\n All the application data can be recovered from the seed phrase!\nDo not share your seed phrase with other people!\n  I would like to donate\n  Thanks for your support.
