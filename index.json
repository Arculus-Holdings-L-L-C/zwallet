It can have any amount greater than zero (including zero). The account balance is the sum of all the note amounts.\nWhen you pay, you take one or many notes and spend them to create new notes that the recipient can later use. This forms a transaction.\nTransactions are broadcast to the network and relayed between nodes. Eventually, they are picked up by a miner that includes them in the blockchain.\nUntil then, a transaction is unconfirmed. If a transaction is in the latest block, it has one confirmation. If it is included in the previous block, it has two confirmations, etc. The more confirmations it has, the less likely it can be reverted.\nNotes are always fully used. They cannot be split.

Notes may not be spendable if they were received recently. In this case, wait for more confirmations or change the setting \u0026ldquo;Number of Confirmations Needed before Spending\u0026rdquo;. Lowering the value increases the risk of having the transaction reverted. By default, the balance in the transparent address cannot be spent. Refer to Use Transparent Balance to enable spending from it.

The app is Shielded by Default.\n  How fast is the synchronization exactly?\nIt depends on the hardware but for average phones, YWallet scans the entire blockchain (as of Sep 2021) in around 1-3 minutes. In the end, your account balances are fully available to spend. The reference wallet SDK is 100x slower.\n  Was there a ZWallet and WarpWallet?\nThere used to be different versions of the app for Ycash and Zcash. The app was initially built for Zcash and was called ZWallet. Then it was ported to Ycash and named YWallet. Unfortunately, the name ZWallet is taken on the Apple Store and the app had to be rebranded WarpWallet.\nNow we have a single version that works for both Ycash and Zcash and the app ZWallet is discontinued.\n  Is it open source?\nYes, the source code is available on github.\n  Why is it not listed on the Zcash website?\nThe source code is pending review by the Zcash team. However, it has been reviewed by the Ycash team and is listed on the Ycash Foundation website.\n  Does it collect data?\nAbsolutely no user data is collected. The wallet only connects to a lightwalletd server (by default the officially sponsored server) and CoinGecko for market prices.\n  Can it connect to any lightwalletd?\nYes, the wallet uses the standard API of lightwalletd. It can connect to ZecWallet version of lightwalletd or your own deployment.\n  Can I receive my mining rewards in my transparent address?\nIt is best not to receive your mining rewards because they need to mature for 100 blocks before they can be spent. The Y/ZWallet cannot shield your balance if any of the UTXO is not old enough. Currently, lightwalletd does not provide an API to get the UTXO age and the shielding transaction will be rejected by the network.\n  How can I keep my account safe?\nThe number one reason for lost coins is failure to have a backup of the seed phrase.\nPlease, DO A BACKUP ASAP and make sure that it is kept in a safe place away from spying eyes.\n All the application data can be recovered from the seed phrase!\nDo not share your seed phrase with other people!\n  "},{"uri":"https://ywallet.app/account/watch-only/","title":"Watch Only","tags":[],"description":"","content":"You can turn a regular account into a watch-only account.

Upgrade to 1.0.12 If you did step 3, transfer the funds from the transparent address back to your wallet  Explanation of the issue YWallet has incorrectly activated Canopy ZIP 212 on the Ycash branch at the same height as Zcash. It expects and creates notes with the new format. Unfortunately, this is not detected by the protocol rules and transactions are mined.\n These notes are not visible by the other wallets. They cannot be spent by them and by YWallet after the fix.\n Only YWallet 1.0.11 and below can see and spend these notes. Therefore they must be transferred to a transparent address before upgrading.\nDo not transfer to a shielded address because it would create another note with the same issue.\nIf you upgrade without transferring these notes, you will need to rollback to version 1.0.11 and rescan your wallet.\nYOUR FUNDS ARE NOT LOST\n"},{"uri":"https://ywallet.app/search/","title":"Search Results","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://ywallet.app/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
