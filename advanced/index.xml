It considers incoming funds as purchases at market price and outgoing funds as sales.
For example, if you receive 1 ZEC when 1 ZEC=140 USD and then spend 0.5 ZEC when 1 ZEC=150 USD, your wallet performance will be:
0.5 x (150 - 140) of realized profit 0.5 x (150 - 140) of unrealized profit If later 1 ZEC=180 USD,</description></item><item><title>MultiPay</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/multipay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/multipay/</guid><description>MultiPay allows you to create a single payment transaction with multiple recipients.

However, it is able to build an unsigned transaction and export it as a file.
The account owner moves the file to another computer that holds the secret key (preferably offline and air-gapped for security).
On the offline computer, he signs the transaction and generate a now valid transaction that he saves to another file.</description></item><item><title>Offline Signature Tutorial</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/offline_signature/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/offline_signature/</guid><description>In this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how to setup an offline account on an air-gapped device and make a transaction from a second device that does not have the account secret key.
This workflow isolates the secret key material from any network device and Internet connection while allowing the user to perform multiple transactions.
You will need two devices that support YWallet. One of them must be connected to the Internet.</description></item><item><title>Sub-Account</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/sub-account/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/sub-account/</guid><description>Main Account Your main account is displayed in bold face. There is one main account for each coin. When you spend and receive coins from the dashboard shortcuts, the funds will be directed to the main account.
The main account is the last account you selected for that particular coin.
Sub Accounts A seed phrase can derive a multitude of accounts. By default, Ywallet uses only the first account.</description></item><item><title>Custom Derivation Path</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/custom_path/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/custom_path/</guid><description>For Transparent Addresses Only For a single account, it is easier to use the scan sub account feature.
If you have funds in a legacy wallet (pre NU-5) that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been upgraded to support transaction V5, your funds are inaccessible.
However, you can create an account in YWallet using the same seed phrase and derivation path.
The resulting secret key and address will be identical and you will be able to sweep your funds.</description></item><item><title>Batch Save/Load</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/batch-save/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/batch-save/</guid><description>Save all your Accounts Save the encryption key! Save the backup file The backup cannot be restored without the encryption key. Note: Every backup gets its unique encryption key (even if the accounts are the same)
Restore a full backup Enter or paste the encryption key Load the backup file</description></item><item><title>Reset</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/reset/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/reset/</guid><description>After a major upgrade, the app may exhibit incorrect behavior. If this happens, the easiest way to fix the issue is to uninstall, reinstall and restore from seed.
You should always have a safe copy of your seed phrase
If your phone or computer crashes and you don&amp;rsquo;t have the seed phrase, your funds are LOST.
But if you really don&amp;rsquo;t have the seed phrase and the app is still working you can try resetting it by following the instructions below.</description></item><item><title>Import from ZecWallet Lite</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/zwl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/zwl/</guid><description>You can import your wallet keys from ZWL directly into YWallet without needing to synchronize ZWL.
This can be useful when ZWL fails to open.
ZecWallet Lite is not responsive until it is fully synced up. If your wallet cannot be synced, you will not be able to operate ZWL. For example, it may get appear stuck on the loading screen.
However, zecwallet-lite-cli the command line version of ZWL has an option to by-pass synchronization.</description></item><item><title>Key Tool</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/keytool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/keytool/</guid><description>The Key Tool is a transparent &amp;amp; secret key derivation tool based on BIP32/39/44 and ZIP32.
It is similar to the Mnemonic Code Converter but built specifically for Zcash and Ycash.
With the Key Tool, you can extract the private keys of most (all?) wallets, as long as they use a seed phrase.
Ledger, Coinomi, Edge, Nighthawk, ZecWallet Lite Zcash (HDSeed), etc. However, the derivation path they use varies from wallet to wallet.</description></item><item><title>Database Encryption</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/db_encrypt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/db_encrypt/</guid><description>Desktop Only If you use the database encryption feature, all the database files are encrypted with 256 bit AES encryption in CBC mode.
The encryption key is derived from your password/passphrase using PBKDF2. For more details, refer to SQLCipher Design.
By encrypting your database files, your accounts are protected in case malware exfiltrates them our of your computer.
This feature is only offered on the desktop versions because mobile devices have file system encryption and application isolation.</description></item><item><title>Standalone YWallet</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/iso/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/iso/</guid><description>In high security/value scenarios where you need a fully isolated deployment of YWallet, you can use Ywallet.iso a live CD/USB with a barebone Linux and YWallet pre-installed.
Ywallet.iso is a ISO image that you can burn to a CD or install on a USB drive, and then boot from it. It is meant to be used as a offline signer. As such, there is no networking capabilities and no persistent state.</description></item></channel></rss>
