There is one main account for each coin. When you spend and receive coins from the dashboard shortcuts, the funds will be directed to the main account.
The main account is the last account you selected for that particular coin.
Sub Accounts A seed phrase can derive a multitude of accounts. By default, Ywallet uses only the first account.
However, if you want to create additional accounts with the same seed, you can tell it to use additional account indexes.</description></item><item><title>Custom Derivation Path</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/custom_path/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/custom_path/</guid><description>For Transparent Addresses Only For a single account, it is easier to use the scan sub account feature.
If you have funds in a legacy wallet (pre NU-5) that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been upgraded to support transaction V5, your funds are inaccessible.
However, you can create an account in YWallet using the same seed phrase and derivation path.
The resulting secret key and address will be identical and you will be able to sweep your funds.</description></item><item><title>Add/Edit/Delete</title><link>https://ywallet.app/contact/manage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/contact/manage/</guid><description> Tap to open the QR code scanner An address should be assigned to a single contact</description></item><item><title>Batch Save/Load</title><link>https://ywallet.app/advanced/batch-save/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/advanced/batch-save/</guid><description>Save all your Accounts Save the encryption key!

Each account has a shielded and transparent address (unless it was restored from a secret key).
An address has zero or more notes. For shielded accounts, notes are encrypted and only visible to the account owner. Transparent addresses have notes in cleartext.
A note is conceptually an &amp;ldquo;I Owe You&amp;rdquo;. It can have any amount greater than zero (including zero). The account balance is the sum of all the note amounts.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to YWallet</title><link>https://ywallet.app/getting-started/first-account/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ywallet.app/getting-started/first-account/</guid><description>When the application starts for the first time or when there aren&amp;rsquo;t any accounts, it will show the welcome page.
