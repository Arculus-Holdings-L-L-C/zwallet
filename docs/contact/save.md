Changes to your contacts are first saved locally on your device.

1. Tap this button if you want to store them in the blockchain.
The app will make a transaction that saves your contact list. It costs
0.01 mZEC or 0.01 mYEC

## Notes

- Contacts that are saved in the blockchain are recovered when the 
account is restored from its seed
