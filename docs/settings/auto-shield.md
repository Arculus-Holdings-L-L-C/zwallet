1. Auto shield your transparent balance when it is higher than this value. 
The app will create a separate transaction
2. Include the transparent balance in the spendable transaction amount

## Remarks

- A value of 0 for option 1 means no automatic shielding
- You can also shield your balance manually at any time
- Option 2 is similar to ZecWallet approach of handling transparent balance
