The person who sends you coins needs to know your account address.
There are several ways to communicate it.

The wallet shows the address on the account page, but it is long and unpractical to type it in.
It is more practical to do one of the following:

1. Copy it to the clipboard and paste it into an email/chat
2. Tilt your device forward and let them scan your QR Code (your balance is hidden)
3. Tap the QR code button and the wallet will show a larger QR code


4. It takes up to a few minutes to have confirmation of a transfer in the blockchain.
Unconfirmed incoming and outgoing funds are shown under the balance
5. This is the current block number. When the wallet detects a new block, it will 
automatically synchronize and update
